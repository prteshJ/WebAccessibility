# Web Accessibility

Hi there! This is the repo for  Web Accessibility. Contained in
this repo are a number of projects to help you improve your
accessibility skills.

## Thinking about Accessibility in Real World?

1> How FREQUENTLY is this piece of UI used?
2> How badly does this accessibility issue AFFECT your users?
3> How EXPENSIVE is it going to be to fix?

## Running the examples

Most of the examples can just have their `index.html` dragged into the browser
in order to run. Some examples may require running a local server, an easy
way to run a local server is with [the Web Server for Chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb?hl=en).

## Found a bug?

if you find anything wrong with the exercises.
